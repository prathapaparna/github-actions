```
-  maven job uploading artifacts into target folder and(we can manually download and also used in another job)
-  docker job downloading automatically those artifacts

# Job Output
- if you want to pass one job output(it can be a value, status, anything) to another job then we can use job outputs
- **ex:** we might want to pass the container's status or URL from one job to another. You can achieve this using job outputs.

**Explanation of Job Output Usage**

- Set Job Output in docker-job

- The step **check_status** checks if the container is running.It assigns "running" or "failed" to the status variable.This is passed as an output in **outputs.container_status**.Use Job Output in verify-container

- needs: docker-job makes sure it runs only after docker-job.It prints the container status from **${{ needs.docker-job.outputs.container_status }}**.
- 
- Using **$GITHUB_OUTPUT** instead of **$GITHUB_ENV**

**$GITHUB_OUTPUT** ensures the value is stored as a job output.
**$GITHUB_ENV** is used for setting environment variables, not job outputs.

# cache dependencies
- Caching dependencies helps reduce build times by storing and **reusing previously downloaded dependencies**. Since your workflow involves build and test, we can cache dependencies for both.
- ðŸ”¹ Benefits of Caching
- ðŸš€ Reduces build times (especially for Maven & Docker builds).
- âœ… Avoids redundant downloads of dependencies.
- ðŸ”¥ Improves CI/CD performance in GitHub Actions.
```
- name: Cache Maven Dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.m2/repository
    key: maven-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
    restore-keys: |
      maven-${{ runner.os }}-
```
âœ… How It Works?

- Caches .m2/repository (Maven dependencies directory).
- If pom.xml changes, dependencies will not be redownloaded.
- If cache is available, it restores dependencies automatically.
