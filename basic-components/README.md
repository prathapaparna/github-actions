## building blocks

in github-actions we have 3 building blocks
 - workflows(jenkinsfile)
 - jobs(stages)
 - steps

 - we can add workflows to GitHub repositories and you can add as many workflows as you want to a given repository.
 - those workflows we have jobs.Now those jobs then contain one or more steps that will be executed in the order
